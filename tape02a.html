Yes, because that&#39;s the way. This is the way it was when I started to work in September 1930. It was an old house, one of Toronto&#39;s old houses, and it was just above the corner of College and Saint George, with the new reference library below it, which was just finished when I arrived. It was a lovely little house, a perfect place for children. It was all theirs and they felt it was all theirs. There was a sort of sun porch on the south side where they came in and brought their books in. Then there were two big rooms and a little room. The front room had a high ceiling, beautiful moulding. It was. It was a lovely room. It had a tiled fireplace in the 19th century Toronto Those tiles have been removed and are in the Osborne collection, set into the wall as a memory. As a memory of that beautiful house. Yes, the room behind the first room that I knew. Where I sat and waited for Miss Smith. The room behind was the reference room where the children did homework, looked up reference questions in a number of good encyclopaedias, and where you were not supposed to help them. It was the first time I had met this sort of thing. They would say to you, do I copy from here to here or from here to here? And I had never met children whose composition was copying until then. Then there was a little room behind which was the little children&#39;s room, and it was absolutely packed every afternoon.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />The little children came every day because their works needed such quick changing, And they would wait till the lock that they had brought in was slipped and ready for circulation again, and then passed them on to their friends. Very much like TV serves now for children after school, you mean? And in those days they went straight to the library. Straight to the library? One of my friends, Miriam Fogle, told me that she got every year at the New year, a loft diary with a key. Yeah. And she kept it. And nobody was allowed to look into it because it was full of her secret. But when she came back to it after ten years and looked, all it ever said was got up, went to school, came home, went to the library, got my books, read them, went to bed. And that was the story of her life, the story of her life behind the little children&#39;s room, which was very small and packed behind. It was a little theatre. I don&#39;t know what the building had been for, but you entered it from the little children&#39;s room. There was a stage, and there we had plays sometimes put on by the staff or the children. The year I arrived, the junior staff, which I was not a member, the junior staff had just finished Toad of Toad Hall. And besides that, the children put on plays.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Miss Thompson had a very active play group, young Jewish boys, who who put on a number of plays. They put I saw them do Lord Dunsany&#39;s A Night at Naomi, A night at the Inn, and Edith and in I Can&#39;t remember, but you know that play. They also did Lady Gregory&#39;s The Rising of the moon. I came and tried to put a little Irish into the accents for that. Not entirely successfully. She had a number of people who later became very famous in TV and things of that sort, in that voice group long, long ago. Do you remember who they were? Yes. Um. The two comedians. Wayne and Shuster. Wayne and Shuster? Yeah. They went to that group. That was their very beginning of theatre. Mhm. Well, I don&#39;t know. They may have had other things, but certainly they were in that group. Yes. A number of other people that you know were part of her group but not, not necessarily at the same time. Do you know Albert Mercury? No I don&#39;t. He does. He&#39;s a young black boy. Or he was a young black boy. He&#39;s a middle aged man now who does a lot of things in the community. But he was one of the best readers ever known at boarding House, and we would use him on radio programs. You mean the way he used his voice and read? No no no no no no no no no no no no no. He read everything and said, oh he just went through everything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Said it was a good book. It was a good book. And Albert asked on radio how he knew it was a good book and said, oh, it&#39;s easy. He just looked at the first page and you can tell. So he had an ear for language and for language, and he loved books. But the core of the work with children was really, I think, in the staff meetings and the classes which were held in that little theatre. In those days, we had a half day. 1:00 on Wednesday was the half day for branches. Boys and girls. House was the only one of the day in the library system that was open on Wednesday. Everyone else had Wednesday off from one on. And in the morning you came in the boys and girls house. The staff meeting started at ten, and before it you had all sorts of things. For instance, we used to do in this country dancing Alice. I am amazed at the different things that went on in a boys and girls house. English country dancing, country dancing. It was not only the junior staff that the people who are in our senior staff were the ones who taught me to dance. Do you know the English dance called Newcastle? No, I don&#39;t know much about it at all. And that was the one that Miss Burkhart taught me. Miss Lyons was a wonderful partner, and it was very, very interesting. Miss Ernst and another staff member started, and then we assembled without our sneakers properly shod.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />You always had to be properly dressed in those days. What was the dress? Well, we weren&#39;t allowed short sleeves. I was sent home once because I had sleeves. You weren&#39;t allowed to on a hot summer day. And of course, you would never have been allowed open toed shoes. That was Mrs. Robinson. She had an eye for propriety. Mhm. But she sent me home either to get a jacket or to get along. And that was the days before air conditioning. Yeah. Okay. It was hot, hot summer. And they weren&#39;t bear arms. They were only from the elbow down. But the staff meetings were, as I say, they the core of the library work. New books were reviewed at the staff meetings. No book was ever bought and put in our shelves without having been first read and accepted. And were you given each a book to read and you were responsible for reporting more than one. I belonged for a long time to the committee. We published a list called books for Boys and Girls, and there was a committee composed of seniors and juniors, with the head of it for each class of books. I worked almost all my life on the Fairy Tale Committee. Yes, I know you have a particular interest and expertise in fairy tales. I love fairy tales from the very earliest. You were. You were drawn to the fairy tale section where it wasn&#39;t that it was assigned to you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />It was assigned to me. But I was drawn to it. But your heart was there. You had a certain amount of choice. You had a certain amount of interest. Miss Trotter was the head of the committee, and she was interesting and nice to work for. And you wrote reviews of all the books you read. And on the staff meeting mornings once or maybe twice a month, especially in the fall when the new books were coming out, and in the spring we got a spate of them. The meeting would be devoted to reviews of new books. Sometimes two people reviewed the same book. If there was a strong difference of opinion and you often got strong differences of opinion. Sounds like lively and interesting group. It was a lively and very interesting group. And then you you ended by voting on them. Can you remember one in particular how it went? Not one in particular or what the differences of opinion would be? I remember one. This is a rude one, but as Miss Smith liked mine better than the first one. But the first review, and I can&#39;t remember the name of the person who did the first review, and it was one of Hildebrand Stalin&#39;s books about Ireland. She had a Dutch father and an Irish mother, and she wrote about both places, and this book was reviewed very glowingly. It was the children of Bantry Bay, and it had quite a. Quite a wide acceptance in the States.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />It was a a very anti-British, pro-irish book about Ireland, which was the most fashionable in the States. But everything seemed geared to that, and it seemed to me an American book for children and too much propaganda. In a way, I think so, yes, I think so. But she gave her review and I was not asked to give my review. Miss Smith said, I have another review, which I want to read you. She was very tactful about that. Yes, yes, yes, I can remember also. I can remember also Marjorie Fleming reviewing a book which I liked very much, which she thought was tremendously silly. It was about a man in great poverty who spent the money that he needed very much for his family and his sick wife on buying to his soldiers with his little boy who needed them to beat somebody else&#39;s grandchildren. Mm. Mhm. Somebody a little older liked the book. Mm. So you had a choice of whether you wanted that for your branch or not. It was not an important book. You graded the books as essential useful and desirable or some word like that and desirable meant a very expensive. The illustrated book or a book that would have a very small circulation. And that would probably be best in libraries, where they had a large stock and where people could go and get it from smaller places. But you didn&#39;t want to spend your, your books money on it in a very small place where it wouldn&#39;t go over you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And you were librarian for a very small place at that time. Well, yes, we did a large circulation, but we had a very small room and we had a very small book budget. So you had to be extremely careful what you chose. But sometimes the desirable book, and I don&#39;t think that was the word, and the desirable book was one that you really needed. Yes. Where you were? Yes. Because we had tremendously good readers. What we had. Well, that&#39;s another story. We&#39;ll leave that for now. All right. No, I&#39;ll tell you, because branches were different. What we had was a very literary public who had no other source of books than the library. They were poor immigrant children for the most part. And what money there was was used for food and shoes and not for buying books. The children up in North Toronto had other sources of books. You mean their families had enough money to buy the books? Bought them books? Sure. But these children, the only books they could get were the library. So it was essential. So it was essential that they have that to have enough. But sometimes they sometimes they desirable book would be more appreciative there than almost anywhere else. The kind of standard that you had for books to choose what was desirable and what was not, and what was essential and what was not. Was that based very much on the kind of things that Lillian Smith said in her book? It&#39;s based entirely on what she said in her book.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And she presided at the staff meetings? Yes. Now, she came to my rescue once. There was we were voting on whether to include a book. In the In Books for Boys and Girls. It was a book about Holland written for American children during the war. I voted against it. The vote for it was overwhelming. Yes, because we had such a desperate need for books about Holland at that time, because the Canadians had gone in to liberate Holland. And this one said, well, you know, they say that so many million Frenchmen can&#39;t be wrong. But I have always doubted that. Tell me why you voted against it. So I said, I voted against it because we needed a book on Hollande, but not really for Canadian children, a book that kept comparing everything in Hollande to Pittsburgh. It was really a book about Pittsburgh, and how Holland differed from it ended by not going in. We voted again. So Mr. Smith could be quite careful in the way she paid attention to her staff. She was careful. Yes. She watched you in your short. You really did. She knew exactly how much time you spent on things, too. She could tell by the review that you wrote and however it was, it was very, very interesting. And while no way did you like all the other members of the staff, you would still have died for any one of them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Yes, it was a very close knit staff, whether you liked them or not. How many of the staff? How many staff were there? Alice. That&#39;s what I was trying to think. Um, I can&#39;t remember at different times, but I remember that once we had when Boys and Girls house was being redone or redecorated or renewed or pulled down or something of that sort, we had the staff Christmas party at Queen Lisner because I thought to invite them, and Miss Smith accepted the first invitation, and I catered for 60 people that day. 60? Well, there were in 1930 there were 18 branches. There were senior staff and junior staff, and there was infant staff. I was infant staff when I remember this all but. Margaret Johnston, meaning Frances Whitehead, you were the infant staff group or you were the infant staff group? We did a play once, too. We did the sheep shearing scene from A Winter&#39;s Tale. Margaret Johnston played the hero. I can&#39;t remember what I played, but I can still recite for you all the all the poetry from that scene. You know, daffodils would come before the swallow dares and take the winds of March with me. It&#39;s very nice. We did it in the theatre and I enjoyed it. We really had a very good time. The staff meetings. If you didn&#39;t have to review a book or tell a story, you were very, very pleasant. If you had to review a book or tell a story, you were in some distress until it was over.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Then every little while, we had long, boring ones where we went through the books alphabetically and voted on again and again. And I can remember Miss Bausch, who was very careful in what they call and corporate character. And I remember her. I&#39;m sorry. Very careful in what what they call in Cork. A character. A character, yes. And she put up her hand as we reached something like W and she said, Miss Smith, dear, could you tell me what came after Alcott Goodwives. So just what she had been doing was that was that her sense of humour? No, she was serious. This is where she was. Which way she was. She. Her speciality was reading Dickens and part of our Christmas concert. Our In style Christmas concert each year for many years. Was Miss Bush reading the Christmas part of Great Expectations? That was her thing. Every Christmas she loved to do it. Can you tell me more about Miss Bush? Miss Bush, she was extremely clever. She was devoted to anything English, particularly trollop. She asked me once if I had read. I forget which of the books, and I said yes greatly. And she said to me, well, tell me, did the Dean&#39;s horse go clippity clippity clop or clop, clop clip? Was she testing you? No, I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t think so. There is a story about her That Miriam taught me. Miriam, who had the diary? It was about his bush being knocked down by a car.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />One day she was crossing Queen&#39;s Park and the car was partly over her and she couldn&#39;t get up. And the young man who drove the car she knew would be in a dreadful state, because her nephew had once run into somebody and he was very, very upset about it. So she lay there trying to think of something that she could say to comfort him. But, you know, when he finally got her up, the only thing she could think of was, thank you for stopping so promptly. That that was Miss Bush. That&#39;s a charming story. Yes. She read other parts of Dickens. I remember her explaining to us the function of Sarah again. She said, When the modern obstetrician came in, Sir William went out. I have never forgotten Sarah again because she read Sarah again. Do you remember what sort of age she was at this time and what she looked like? She was round and soft and plump and delicate. You know, one of those rounds of plump, very delicate people. She was a generation older than I was. She did everything very properly. I remember her telling us that during the war on Sundays, she listened to an Episcopalian church service on the radio when the weather was too bad to go out. And she must confess that Sunday or not, she carried on with her knitting for the war effort. Of course She sighed and stood up for the creep that has this much.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Oh, I don&#39;t know. Another story about her. That&#39;s a library story, though. They were having great trouble at Yorkville. It was a small library, and it had two very diverse kinds of children. It had children whose parents were professors. That sort of person? Yes, very high class. The children who came with their parents. And then they had 2 or 3 really downtown slum streets from which the children came. They were rude. They stole and they used language which was not pleasing to the other half of the group. Yes, they said, Miss Bush there. Those were the days before everything was arranged in layers. You could protect the person who is the head of the largest library there was, and send her to the smallest place there was, without loss of face, without loss of pay, without loss of anything. And she could try her hand there and see what she could do. But Miss Bush went to Louisville, and pretty soon the children were bowing from the waist and treating everybody with great politeness. How did she do it? She bowed to them. She treated them with her usual excessive courtesy, and her usual excessive courtesy produce the result. This I have always believed to be true. With children. If you treat them like gentlemen, they behave like gentlemen. And she certainly believed it. But she put a sign up which said it is wrong to steal the library pencils, and it was as if the children had not known that before, because they stopped stealing the library pencils.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And when she had got the whole place fixed, she was withdrawn and sent back to her somewhere else. Would you say that she had a deep caring for children? Oh, yes. Yes. But I think perhaps not in the sense that they say it today. She had a pleasant aloofness with children, which they. Which they appreciate it. Yes. Of my friends, the ones who were the greatest success with children outside the library and with my little cousins, they were nearly always shy, and they treated the children with courtesy and and descend upon delivery. What&#39;s the modern phrase? Come on. Too strong. She never came on too strong. So she was delicate in that sense. She was delicate in that sense. That&#39;s a wonderful story about miss. She was. They had wonderful stories about her, and Marion Cook could tell you more than I can because she was her great friend and she worked with her a great deal. Just a moment, Alice. I&#39;m just going to check this to see how the sound is. Yes. You were going to tell me some more about Miss Bush? Oh, I think that&#39;s that&#39;s enough. Is that enough in this book? Just about all I know of Miss Bush. Except that she read the classics. Yes. And the children who came to her also read the classics, because that was what she thought was worth reading. She didn&#39;t really like a great many of what I would call children&#39;s classics, many of the best books for children.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />She thought they were frivolous, I think. So she had a very serious streak. Did she have a sense of humour? Not the same. It doesn&#39;t sound. It&#39;s different than yours. Momentarily. There were other people. Um, Miss Thompson gave the book reviews that I can still remember. Miss Thompson never gave a smooth book review. And you had to think very hard. You worked as hard as she did during the book review, but you never forgot them. And what she had to say was worth hearing. What do you mean by smooth? She didn&#39;t give a smooth. They weren&#39;t polished, right? Sometimes you can get a book review which is so polished that that you are lost in admiration of the Polish, but you might slide off it and not retain it. You don&#39;t hear what&#39;s being said. The work you do, the work you have to put into it, the thinking you do is what produces the memory, I think. So she was very skilled at leaving spaces and jagged edges for you to. She wasn&#39;t skilled at doing it. It was the way she operated. The way she operated. I remember still a review of The White Company. She thought we weren&#39;t using this enough. She thought we had let it be supplanted by less desirable books, and she was giving an impassioned appeal for the White Company. Other people reviewed other things, and poetry was run in stocks. But she didn&#39;t review all the poetry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />She had a committee as well. I can remember Helen Silver, who was on her committee once, getting lost in a poem that she was reading. She just suddenly stopped and her face glowed. And she was she had gone wherever the poem led her. Oh, and Mrs. Smith looked at her for a minute and smiled, and then put the book back into her hands were it to go on. But Miss The stock. Also read and she she could read poetry, but of course she had gone to school in England, where they learned to read children at English schools, learned to read and to express themselves in their mother tongue. And this is very useful because somebody else that we had a much, much later person was Chris Stewart, and she was on the fairy tale committee at one time. And you could say to her when you were preparing the book notes for a long, long booklet, you could say to her, would you write a quick note on this not more than 25 words, please, saying this and this, but not mentioning this, and it cannot begin with 25 tales from or Grimm or any of the following words, because the reviews above and below And she could go off without me at the most ten minutes and come back with the perfect view. That was a very useful thing to have. Some people who had good ideas were very productive. There is a review on Record of Mrs. Endicott&#39;s.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">I typed it in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />The book to be reviewed was called The Earth for sound, and the review said simply, the Earth for sound, but not for gaming. And wit and wit? Yes. The other thing that happened at staff meetings, and we didn&#39;t realise at the time when we were very young how lucky we were. It was afterwards, when we were talking to a friend from one of the big American libraries. I won&#39;t tell you which that we understood what had been done for us, she said. You know what? Miss Smith is so proud of herself. And when a visitor comes, the visitor always sees Miss Smith&#39;s staff, and they see her. Now, she said, when we have a visitor coming, like, let us say Anne Carroll Moore. If Anne Carroll Moore is coming to us, we see that all the desks are manned and that everybody is looking well. The air is cold and she&#39;s in a proper dress and the place is fresh and there are flowers, and she is whisked through the rooms by the top brass and shown everything, and then taken out to a long lunch. Very different approach, very different approach when Anne Carroll Moore comes The Toronto. She meets all the staff by name. She&#39;s introduced to every one of them until what their speciality is. There is usually a party for her where people can talk to her so that her. Yes. And there is a staff meeting where she speaks very well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />She talks to the impressive to the top of the house, not to the board, not to the, but to the people themselves. And I remember many of these. And that was the way I met Anne Carroll Moore, though I met her first in library school. Miss Smith brought her in one day to our class the year I was at Library school, but also Dorothy Hosford, who wrote the Viking stories, who retold the Viking stories for children, sons of the Balsams and. So they would visit too. She would visit as well. She would visit as well and we all got to know her. We felt we knew them all. A number of others. For some reason, I can&#39;t think of anybody now. A man from Rochester whose name suddenly escapes quite escapes me. Very rich old age, surely. It was very, very rich. And we our opinions, our thoughts or paid attention to them. That&#39;s impressive, because even you know, in these days, when the idea of of having the grassroots people speak up, perhaps a little more clearly is more common. You often get staffs where they are not paid attention to by visiting celebrities. So that was impressive of Miss Smith to do that. We met them all. We met them all. What do you remember of Caroline Moore? I&#39;m Carol Moore. Caramel and caramel. I remember her best when she came up as an old, old woman. Now she was always to me an old woman.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Because at 22, 30 years old, it really is. But she was a really old woman when she made a week&#39;s visit to Toronto. She stayed with Miss Smith. They were friends. They were friends. She had been. I think Miss Smith&#39;s first boss. I think it was from her that Miss Smith came to Toronto. Or on her recommendation to Doctor Locke. Maybe. I wonder if the way Miss Smith learned to be a boss was because of Ann Carroll Moore&#39;s influence. Did she teach her how to do that? I don&#39;t know, because their ways were different in many, many ways. But still she came. She talked to us at staff meetings. She appeared on. Radio. Appeared in The word for radio. Is it? She could have appeared on TV. She was very spectacular. She never entered the room till everyone was assembled. She made an entrance and she would wear a long black velvet cape lined with scarlet, which she would throw back over her shoulder. A trick that my friend Ruth Steadman did with puppets when she was making the King for Puss in Boots. She he had the same beautiful lined cape which he she learned to throw back over his shoulder in a lovely gesture. It was her pride and joy that that gesture. Yeah. And then we had a party one night. We. I had a call night afternoon from Miss Thompson in the middle of the afternoon, and she said.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />That because of changes, as I knew because of changes in the radio schedule and Carol Moore&#39;s party for our staff had to be that night, and she said the caterer has just baulked at this. What can I get ready for 60 people quickly? Besides, Ritz crackers spread with Cheese Whiz, which was not exactly the most elegant food for an Carol Moore. So I said, well, you could do this or this or this or this. And she said, oh, Miss Kim. I said, well, Miss Thompson, if I could leave at five. I could do this. You could. You could leave right now. So off you went. I said, no, I don&#39;t need to leave right now. I just need to phone my grocery right now. So I phoned Jay Blood Butcher at the corner of Sussex and Huron. I think it&#39;s an antique shop now, and told them my problem, and they said they would have the material on my doorstep at 5:15 when I got home, and the butter would be soft and everything else would be ready and sliced. So with the help of my landlady&#39;s daughter, Glen hood, who is the mother of Ian Bell of Murray York, and with the help of my friend Ruth Steadman and the help of my friend Eleanor Kelly, we made hot rolled out mushroom Sandwiches. We made little rounds of bread with shrimps with a piece of lemon in each mouth. We made ribbon sandwiches with cottage cheese and pickles and things on white bread, and we piled these all up on trays, some to go into the oven and be heated like the mushroom and the cheese ones, the spicy cheese ones, and some just to be served cold.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And we took a taxi up holding these piles of trays in our laps, and we arrived and went up the back stairs carefully because the guests were coming in at the front. It sounds as if you could have had a career as a caterer as well as a librarian. No no no no no no no no no no no. That was my friends again. Did it with buttered bread and rolled things up. But we told stories that night, you see. Suddenly I found that this was not enough. I had to come in and tell the story to an owner. I remember sitting at her feet and telling her, the white trout are the story. That&#39;s the beautiful story you have on your tape. One of them? Yes. Yes. Yes. But that that is the sort of thing. Now, she had many things to say, and she had very strong opinions. And there were things she believed, and there were things she didn&#39;t believe in. But she had a great respect for children. She felt they were people. She said, if you grew up in a small town, you learned that everyone was a person in a small town or a village like the one in which she grew up.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Yes, you weren&#39;t all in layers, divided by age, or divided by class, or divided by good or bad or rich or poor. You were all the people of the village, and there were the best people in the world. There were saints there, and there were total failures, drunkards. But everybody had a particular place, had a place. They were part of that. And she brought that to her library. Children are like that too. Yes they are. They are specific and separate and different and must be appreciated as, as as as individuals. That was wonderful teaching to bring to her work. Yes. And then she passed that on to her students and to others. She didn&#39;t believe in censorship. She thought that this censoring books for children and refusing to let them hear or see anything that you didn&#39;t believe in, just gave them a an unhealthy curiosity about what was being hidden from you if you were quite open with them. They received it quite openly and naturally. There were people, you see, who who would have censored Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn because of the language. Somebody said, darn, and somebody said, you&#39;re a liar. Yes, but she wouldn&#39;t allow that. She wouldn&#39;t allow that. She wouldn&#39;t, um, she wouldn&#39;t turn down books in which people spoke in the slang of or in the dialect of their own place, which some people objected to. I heard a teacher once say, how can you teach a child to speak English if you give them a book where the people speak like this? What was her reply? What would be? What would be? Anne Carol Moore&#39;s reply.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Um, I don&#39;t know, but I can imagine it. I didn&#39;t hear her faced with that particular one, but that was the staff meeting. And as they say, it was the root and the centre of our. Of our lives. I wonder if I could just go back for a moment to Anne Carroll Moore. You said that she had made a splendid entrance, and you described this wonderful cloak and the gesture. Was she a tall woman? She was tall to me. She was tall and slight to me. And I&#39;m not very good in her tall she was. And I never stood against her or danced with her or anything like that. I know there are ways of recalling, but she gave an impression of height. She gave an extension of height. Of course, the long cloak would do that. She also went dashing out whenever there was an hour to spare, and walked in the ravine behind their house and there in Summerhill Gardens. So she loved to walk. And she liked to. She loved to walk, and she nothing, nothing was too much effort for her. She never seemed to tire. Tremendous energy, I tell you. The person who reminds me a little of her. Not in appearance, not in what she says, but just in the kind of person she is, is Katharine Hepburn.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Do you do you know what I&#39;m trying to say? The stride, for one thing. Tremendous vigour. Tremendous sense of self and. Yes. Well, both of those. Vigour and sense of self and sense of background. Yes, yes. And standards. Yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. But there were other people who came as well. And. They were shown to us. We knew them. We we felt part of the whole system. And when we went to a Seal, a Canadian Library Association meeting or an Ontario Library Association meeting, there was not a children&#39;s librarian anywhere that we didn&#39;t know. We knew them all. So you were in strong contact with them? Yes. No, I don&#39;t know anyone. But. But nowadays, there is no children&#39;s division in the same way. And this was a very close knit division. And it no longer. It was destroyed by the new systems that came in. Mind you. Your own youth is always a golden age to you. And what they did then was right. My mother&#39;s two bad words were new, improved, and change was synonymous with decay. And I think change is now, in my mind, synonymous with decay. Well, in many ways it certainly I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any doubt, is there, that there was a tremendous golden age of storytelling for children and libraries, for children that we just don&#39;t have in the present stage.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Know that you really maybe were in a golden age, and it isn&#39;t just your memory, you know? No, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that because there were the books that come out now, don&#39;t seem to me to be of the same really high quality. They seem to be useful books, more than desirable books, and certainly more than a sense of. Yes, a great many of them could come or go, and nobody and nobody would notice that they weren&#39;t at that high calibre. Did you finish everything you wanted to say about the staff meeting? I think so. I think so. I know that when the the five day week came in, it was the thing that disturbed me with, with most about the five day week. What were we going to do about the staff meeting? This, um, is beginning to, uh, go back and forth. So it means that the end of the tape is almost there. Do you see that little blink? Yes, I see it. She could not operate the library system without a staff meeting, so we moved it to Mondays. I&#39;m not quite sure, because I&#39;m not that used to this machine. How much longer it takes? But we could get it now because we have said yes, that she couldn&#39;t operate without it. It was an essential core. And that was when something changed with Saturday. You said. No, we had a five day week, Which meant that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">We didn&#39;t have a Wednesday morning to work. We had Wednesday morning off.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />So we moved the staff meeting to Monday morning. And you were not allowed to make any engagements for Monday morning. You weren&#39;t allowed to have classes coming or anything like that. That was sacred to the staff, that was sacred to the staff meeting. You started your week with it every week. But it might be, it might be. So it was not safe to count on it. But the Wednesday morning to have Wednesday morning off, that means that you really had a very chopped up day. You had to come into work Wednesday afternoon and you had to work. You said that you had Wednesday morning. Wednesday morning. On we had the half day starting.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the world’s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-mp3-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your mp3 files to text">Automatically convert your mp3 files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="automatic transcription software" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed">automatic transcription software</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="upload many different filetypes" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/list-of-languages-and-filetypes?utm_source=embed">upload many different filetypes</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="world-class support" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/world-class-support?utm_source=embed">world-class support</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="collaboration tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/collaborate-with-teams?utm_source=embed">collaboration tools</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
