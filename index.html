In choral speaking, the beauty of Israel is slain in the high places. How are the mighty fallen? And it was just glorious. There must have been thrilled. Yes, they were very thrilled. And then they went to Russia and saw Miss Thompson came back, and she kept saying she&#39;d seen uncle Tom Sawyer, and we&#39;re not quite sure what she&#39;d seen, whether it was Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin or Uncle Tom&#39;s Sawyer, because she got, you know, the way you get a thing about you don&#39;t stutter, so you don&#39;t know. But if you stutter and you stutter in a place, one particular place, you&#39;ll stutter in that place every time you come to it. No I didn&#39;t. And every time she came to talk about this, she did this to uncle Tom. So she stuttered. Did she? No, but she said uncle Tom Sawyer no matter what, because she couldn&#39;t help her put her. What about your stutter, Alice? What effect did that have to your story? It had no effect, I stopped stuttering. I stopped being afraid. So the minute that you stopped being afraid, then it stopped. And did that happen quite soon? Yes, that happened really very soon. I started occasionally, and I&#39;m more apt to stutter still when I&#39;m reading. Reading something aloud to a group of people. Yes. Than I am then.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And I&#39;ve never stuttered behind a puppet stage. And I have a story about that that I&#39;ll tell you. Okay. Something that I used to do a lot with classes that came every two weeks to the library as a regular thing with their teacher. If they were what used to be known as an opportunity class. Now it&#39;s called special education. And they were children with problems. And it was very nice to do a puppet show with them. They used to make their puppets. Yes. Paint them. Make them write their plays. They were pretty awful, the puppets, but they thought they were lovely. And they enjoyed doing it. And then they would give a show and we would ask another class of the same kind from a different school, who would then return it. But we had we were doing the Golden Goose once, and we had a little boy called Nicky who was in the class because he stammered, he had the most dreadful stammer and the sentiment of every kind of speech therapy, and nobody seemed to be able to do anything about Nicky&#39;s stammer. And he had made a very nice puppet for the little grey man. And his teacher said to me, we&#39;ll have to find somebody to speak Nicky&#39;s part. And I said, don&#39;t let&#39;s have anybody speak Nicky&#39;s part.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />It&#39;s a very small part anyway. It doesn&#39;t matter if he does stammer over it, but let Nicky speak his mind. What? Nicky didn&#39;t stammer at all. Because, you see, this was the little grey man, not Nicky. The little grey man didn&#39;t stammer, so there was no need to stammer. It taught me why I didn&#39;t stammer to he from then on. From then on, he began to be better when he realised that he could see clearly and he couldn&#39;t do it, and he was hidden from his sight. He must have seen some wonderful things in a new work for children. Things? Yes. We used to tell stories and have them acted out. That was another thing we did with them. These opportunity class children, they in many ways got the most from coming to the library. Nobody, nobody thought they were worth bothering with. You know, in the school system, they were left out of so many things. So this was one place where they were most welcome. And they loved stories. They loved stories. Not very imaginative stories. They liked funny stories, and they liked animal stories. And they liked very straightforward stories. But one day they were there and they said, would you like to make a play of this. And I just told them the guinea wolf and the penny wolf.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />I very foolishly let them cast it. So they chose the biggest girl to be the mother and the biggest boy to be the guinea wolf. And then a pretty, pretty little girl to be the little girl. Mhm. And she went and hid behind the puppet stage which I gathered was the house. And she came rushing out the door at one point and picked flowers. And she went down there and picked more flowers. And then she rushed over here and picked more flowers. And then she dashed back down to the edge of the head and the play was over. I was about to ask her, I said, that was very nice. I was about to ask her to make it a little longer, but her teacher shook her head at me. And so we went on to something else. We just applauded this play. The teacher said to me, she&#39;s a borderline child. If we got a lot of applications for this class, she could be excluded from Still, her IQ is so low that she can be excluded from school as not unteachable. She said I wouldn&#39;t have believed she could hear a story and even even know that much about what it was about. She said it&#39;s just amazing. Yes. So you saw the children on her report card? Yes. Yes. But I saw myself come alive.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Because, you see, the thing that finally told me what had happened to me was when I was doing a puppet show one day, and mostly I had to take all the speaking parts and my desk people would come in at the last minute and hold the puppets for me. But I had to speak because I knew what the play was about and I could come on. I was the good little girl. I was the kind little mouse. There was all these things. Nobody said anything. But the minute the witch came stamping across the stage or the giant came roaring. Somebody would say, there&#39;s Miss Kane. Yes. And I realised what had happened to me. What had happened to you? Yes I had. I learned what it felt like to be a giant. Yes. And if you know what it feels like to be a giant, you stop being afraid. What about the witch? Same with the witch. You know what a witch feels like. John Berjew says you&#39;re everything in the story. And everything in the story is you. And if you had told me that a long time ago, I wouldn&#39;t have understood it. But I understand you understand it now? Yes. And when you were, though not the way she understands it. Because I still don&#39;t know how to play a rock.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Yes. Because she tried to. To get you to play a rock. Well, somebody played rocks and something that I was in that she was doing. Yes. Well, you were still in your 20s, were you, when this was happening? Some of it. Some of it? Yes. You&#39;ve got your own school. Your own library? Yes. Well, only. Only the children&#39;s room. The children&#39;s room. At that time, there was no such thing as a branch head. Who was the children&#39;s librarian? The children&#39;s librarians were subservient always to the branch head, who felt very important. The attitude of the adult department was only children&#39;s work, and our attitude was that they were only adult librarians. They didn&#39;t know their books. When you asked them about something, they said, oh, it&#39;s got good reviews. We could never get away with that. We had to read all the books on our shelves and know them thoroughly and know them thoroughly, and we read them because, as Miss Smith said, the book you read last week is the one you&#39;re giving out this week. The book you read five years ago is not fresh in your mind. It certainly hasn&#39;t been the life of the books you read last week has. Well, Alice, let&#39;s have some of this I find. Let me see. Let&#39;s have some of.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the world’s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-mp3-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your mp3 files to text">Automatically convert your mp3 files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="advanced search" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/organize-and-search?utm_source=embed">advanced search</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="share transcripts" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/share-and-publish?utm_source=embed">share transcripts</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="automatic transcription software" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed">automatic transcription software</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="generate automated summaries powered by AI" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/automated-summaries?utm_source=embed">generate automated summaries powered by AI</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
