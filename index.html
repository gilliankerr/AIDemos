I graduated from McGill in 1930.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />Yes</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />The year before, people had their choice of jobs. It was at a peak, and you could have what seemed a fabulous salary, and you could choose anything you wanted to do. And here, suddenly in 1930, there were no jobs available for anybody. No jobs for anybody. And I came up on a visit to Toronto with my friend Alice Hand, who lived in Hamilton.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />Yes</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />Because I talked in a vague way about wanting to work with children in books. I had an idea of getting a job in a publishing house of what I could do in a publishing house. I have no idea now. And I had no idea then, but I talked about it. You talk about things when there are no chances of anything real happening. And I stayed with Alice and her family at their house on the highway between Hamilton and Toronto, near Burlington, and we used to come into Hamilton on Sunday mornings to church. And one Sunday morning the car broke down. So we went into the rectory to wait for the man to come and fix the car. The rector was Canon Judd, who had been the principal at KCS in Halifax.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />Yes</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />When I was at Netherwood and he used to change pulpits occasionally with Doctor Hibbert, who was the boys principal at my school.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />So I knew about him, but his sister was there and she was very nice to me. I was extremely shy and she asked me what I was doing. So I told her in my airy fashion that I was trying to find a job with children and books.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />And how old were you then, Alice?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />22.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />22!</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />22, chronologically. About 12, I think.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />12 emotionally?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />Yes. Oh, in any way. I was I was really a child. And she said to me, oh, well, you must see Lillian Smith. The person you must see is Lillian Smith. So I said, Who is Lillian Smith? And she told me who was Lillian Smith, and I made an appointment to see her. She just phoned her up and said, I am Alice. And, well, they gave me an appointment to see her. I don&#39;t think she was very willing to see me, but she she agreed to. And Alice drove me to town, and Mrs. Hand drove me to town, and we I went down to keep the appointment and Miss Smith. This method. Don&#39;t think wanted to see me at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />How could you tell?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />Because she kept me waiting about three hours. Three hours? And I had never seen anything like the place where I waited. Where was it? It was the reading room at Boys and girls house.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />I had never seen a children&#39;s library like this before. I had never seen anything like it before in my life. And all thoughts of publishing houses faded from my mind. And I wanted this. I didn&#39;t want any other thing in the world. I wanted a job here. Could you describe what it was that drew you? Or what happened to you, what you saw? It was children with unlimited books and people who seemed to have time to tell them where to find what they wanted and to get them a book like the last one they had. And it seemed important. Instead of telling them they shouldn&#39;t be reading so much, they should be out playing. They were helping them get get books. They were poor little Children not extra clean, many of them. And it was it was dark and the place was just full of books. Miss Lyons came and talked to me and she took me out into the reading room. That&#39;s Kathleen Lyons, and she showed me a number of books, very beautiful treasure type books like The Buddha de Marvell, Joan of Arc and A Lovely Thing in the Bayeux Tapestry. Things like that that I found very exciting. She gave me a little list to check with the books I had read, and I could check most of the books on the list, though I didn&#39;t realise that when I was checking a Robin Hood it probably wasn&#39;t the right Robin Hood or when I checked King Arthur.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />It wasn&#39;t the right King Arthur. I did it in perfectly good faith. And then I saw Miss Smith, and she explained to me that she had no jobs. She just had no jobs. There were no jobs. This was the fall of 1930, she explained to me. So was the interview very short? Not very short, I don&#39;t think. I can&#39;t remember an awful lot about it. I remember that I cried. I told her I had never wanted a job before. Really? Oh, and you&#39;d fallen in love with a job. I wanted this, and then suddenly I pulled out my last card, my Trump, and I said, I can type, and I handed her a certificate. She said I could type. Those were days when everybody couldn&#39;t take. Aha. So it was special. And she said, well, she didn&#39;t think she had any jobs, but she would see and she would let me know. And she took my address and I went home feeling we didn&#39;t have it. And I had also applied to a, a couple of women, one of whom was called, believe it or not, True Davidson. True Davidson and the true Davidson, the true Davidson and Margaret McKenzie. And they were both young women and they were running an employment bureau.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And I went to see them and I got true Davidson, who was a young woman with lots and lots of beads, and she gave me some dictation, and I didn&#39;t know the word format. She had to explain to me what format meant. And she said, you are going to work in a publishing house and you don&#39;t know the word format. I met her many, many years later. Oh, certainly 40 years later, and I think maybe more at the opening of a new library in East Shore. Yes. And she I was being shown down the receiving line. You see, I said to her, you won&#39;t remember me, but I came to you long, long ago looking for a job. And she said you were my first customer. So she didn&#39;t know the word format. It&#39;s almost unbelievable, isn&#39;t it? So that was. That&#39;s the reason why she was so popular, I think, with everybody because she had this way of remembering. But but I really had very little hope of the other job materialising. Do you remember what you wore and what you looked like when you went there, and what Lillian Smith looked like? I remember what Lillian Smith looked like. But then, you see, I was 22, so she looked old to me. She looked old, like my mother. She was probably about 40 something. I don&#39;t know how old she was.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">Uh. I wasn&#39;t all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />That interested in her. I was interested in this place. And I had never seen the like of it before. Where was the boys and girls library at that time? It was at 40 Saint George Street, and it was called Boys and Girls House. Yes. And it was a house. Sometime. I&#39;ll show you a picture of it. I have a postcard of it. Does it still exist? It exists as a branch library, but the house doesn&#39;t exist. It was declared unsafe. It was pulled down and was pulled down. And it was too bad because it was a beautiful old house and the children loved it. It was all theirs. There was a circulating room as you went in the hall. There was a little room at the back with picture books for the little children, and then there was a little theatre behind it. Sounds magical. Oh, it was absolutely magical. Offices were upstairs, and there was a picture collection and a reference collection upstairs. It was. It was beyond belief. Well, I went back home with Alice and we came in and tried the true Davidson thing. One day she applied also, and and suddenly there was a letter from his lines. I still have it to saying that Miss Smith had a job for me. If I would like to come in and see her about it. So I went in and saw her about it, not knowing that I was going to be killed, and I had an overnight bag and a toothbrush and nothing else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And I was kept that day, and I got the job and it was. So you had to go in from out of town, then from Hamilton. From Hamilton. I still have. Nearly a month of that. Yes. And we went to the Y. Got a room there. You had your job first, and then you went to the Y with your bag and your toothbrush. And. Alice. Yes. Who stayed with me? Where was the Y in those days? It was in Elm Street. And it was. It was awful. It was downtown, in the middle of the noise and confusion of summer. Oh, I&#39;ve never seen anything as awful as Elm Street was. I had never seen anything like it in those days. But the job was to be this lime secretary and to type her letters for her. I had shorthand and quickly forgot the shorthand because it embarrassed her to dictate letters to me. So she wrote the letters out, and then I typed them, and pretty soon they began to use me in the library downstairs as well, just for jobs at first. And then little by little, they let me work with the children. And how did you start working with the children? What would they let you do? They would let me help them find books, because I knew a fair number of the books, and those were the days before certification had come in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />You were trained the you were trained within the library. So if you were hired within the library system, they could train you and then train like an apprentice system. Yes. Rather than giving you any sort of diploma or. Yes. But then the certification came in in a very few years. But you. What did you graduate from? Mcgill in English and history? Yes. What sort of, uh. Um, how many years did you go or what was the four years? But from. Not from grade 13? Yes, from grade 12. English and history and history. Would that be an honours? That was a that was an honours BA at McGill, which was different from an honours BA at Toronto, where you come in and take four years and tell them your grade 13. But anyway, there we were. And then my mother came up to see me and she had a long talk with Miss Smith. I don&#39;t think my mother knew what it was all about, but Miss Smith explained to her that I should go to library school because certification was coming in. Mm. Was that sensible advice? Oh, that was the only advice at the age I was if you were senior staff at that time, certification did not apply to you because of. But if you were a junior staff, you had to be certified or you couldn&#39;t or you couldn&#39;t show up. So I went to library school. A year after that, that was 32, 33.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />I went to library school and then I was a children&#39;s librarian. And then came the rub. I found that I was expected to tell stories. Me, me tell stories all through my school days. My teacher said to me, speak up, Alice. Speak up. And the little school I went to in Ireland. It didn&#39;t matter very much whether I spoke up or not. Why was that? Because we didn&#39;t have any classes. We didn&#39;t do anything on a large scale. So everything was very small and intimate. And if you had a soft voice, it didn&#39;t matter. It didn&#39;t matter. It was a 1 to 1 sort of arrangement. But when I got the other thing I&#39;d never done was write on a board. So talking to a whole class and writing on a board were things that were absolutely unknown to me and storytelling. And I knew I could never do it. And I also stammered. You stammered. Oh, I stammered. From early childhood. No, I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t remember stammering in early childhood. I remember stammering in my grown up, frightened young days. I don&#39;t think you have any concept of how I was so scared. I was no one of my early bosses, Mary Baldwin told her. I reminded her of a frightened rabbit hole. And I think I probably did. Can you remember how it felt? Oh, I was just petrified. I was petrified of everyone and everything. And I had never.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Been really scolded except at home. The way children are. But I had never been scolded outside till I came into the library staff. But it was the reason why I didn&#39;t want a job. Why I was so scared of jobs. I had read books about people with jobs. Yes. And there was the boss who scolded you because you were late. Actually, it was all very, very kind indeed. I used to go home with Alice for the weekends, and Mrs. Hand, who came into town on business, would drive us back on Monday morning. And one Monday morning she had a small accident on the way back, and knowing how frightened I was about being late for work, she persuaded some people who were passing to drive me in, and they took me in and dropped me off at Keele, and. I don&#39;t know where it way up in the northwest end of the city. I had no idea where I was. They weren&#39;t all that happy about having to take me, I think. And they didn&#39;t know how to tell me how to get to work. So I saw people with notebooks under their arms who looked like students. So I just followed them, and we got down to Saint George and McCall. And from there I found my way. A little late to boys and girls house. Did you get scolded? 9:20. And Miss Lyons had not yet come in. But when she came, I said, Miss Lyons, I have to speak to you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />So I told her how terrified I was, and she looked at me and she went off, and I thought, oh, she&#39;s going to tell Miss Smith, and I&#39;m going to be fired. And what she&#39;d gone to do was to put the kettle on and make me a cup of tea. She took me down to the kitchen in the middle of the morning and I drank tea. Right? Yes. Good. Good. Yes. She saw that you were very frightened then? I think so, yes. She also was always protecting me from wrath all around me. She was very protective. She was very kind to me. And then I went to library school, as they say. Where was the library school? The library school was up. You know that building at the corner of Spadina and Bloor on the south east corner? That big red building. That&#39;s the College of Education. Yes I do. And has UTS in the top of it. Yes I do. Well, that&#39;s where I went to library school. In the top floor of that in the old days. It&#39;s not there anymore. And it&#39;s in the Robarts building now. But there it was. It smelled of boys school. It smelled of chalk and sneakers and turnips. And we walked up endless stairs. And when I finished there, I was a children&#39;s librarian and suddenly found that I was expected, like children&#39;s librarians, to tell stories.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Yes. And they hadn&#39;t warned you during this course, which lasted, what, a year or two years? Oh, one year then? Yes, just one year then. They hadn&#39;t warned you that this would happen to me, that this would happen? Yes. And you were worried that a course in it. You had a course? Course? Do you remember the course? And who taught it and what? Well, yes, the course in it was with Miss Smith. But she wasn&#39;t supposed to be the person that taught it. Janet Murray Kenny was supposed to be the person who taught storytelling. Unfortunately, it was to start on a Monday, and on the Sunday afternoon, Janet and four other people were involved in an accident. An accident at a level crossing in which somebody was killed. And Janet was very badly injured and was in hospital for the best part of a year. And instead of Janet up the stairs they came. Miss Smith, who taught us storytelling. I didn&#39;t like the idea of it, and I was didn&#39;t want to teach it. The first thing I had to do for Miss Smith. Was to learn an Aesop&#39;s fable. Now that I am older, I realise that that was for me a very bad beginning. It&#39;s a very bad beginning to have your story picked for you. Yes. You learned that right away. I mean, did you know that right away and told it? Well, I resented it right away. You resented it right away.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Resented it. And I wasn&#39;t giving given to resenting things. What the grown ups told me, I mostly did. But then the next story that was chosen for me, I resented also. It was master of all masters. But those short stories, those are very hard to tell. More and more, as I grow older, I realise how hard short stories are to tell. They have to be absolute and utter perfection. And the key short. How short is short hours? Well, Aesop&#39;s is an Aesop&#39;s fable is about 2 or 3 minutes of a storyteller. Okay, yes. So you started with a very difficult story that didn&#39;t appeal to your heart. It sounds like. Well, yes it was. It was like scales. And they don&#39;t teach children scales anymore the way they used to in my day to remember getting up and giving it. And what happened? Um, not really, I remember that I didn&#39;t like it. I remember it was a totally unpleasant experience. The next thing that Miss Smith did was to teach us a beautiful version of The Sleeping Beauty, the whole class, which I have still in times past, and the king and queen who said to each other every day of their lives would that we had a child. But they had none. But it happened once when the Queen went bathing, that a frog came out of the water and squatted in the ground beside her and said, O Queen! Your wish has been fulfilled before.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">A year has gone by. You will have a child.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />We learnt that then, and I still have that story. We still love it. It&#39;s the rhythm of the language, isn&#39;t it? We learnt it all by heart, so that we were very much inclined to say. In times past there lived a king and queen who said to each other every day of their lives would that we had a child. This is the thing about learning it off by heart. Now some people do that. Linda, for instance, Linda House learns her stories off by heart, and then she uses them as an instrument. It&#39;s as if it were a script. And She learns it and she plays with it and she&#39;s doing the vacuuming.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">Or anything else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Then we had classes in storytelling as in-service training, and those were with Miss Trotter, and that was a different kettle of fish. She allowed you much more freedom, and you did a great deal of discussion. You read before you picked your story. Yes. You read as many versions of it as you could find. And this was not just the ones that were in the children&#39;s and the children&#39;s shelves. There was a tremendously excellent professional study collection that was there for us to use. How big was your class, Alice? Was it a very tiny class or. It was pretty tiny. 6 to 8 of us, probably young women. Young women. No men at that time, no man at that time at all. Mr. Fricker came in a little later, but I was bigger by then and was never in a class with him. Can you tell me why Lillian Smith and Francis Trotter taught storytelling or thought it was important? Had they been taught that it was important, or where did they get the idea? From the American libraries? Yes. Now, there were all those great names in the early days of storytelling and the American libraries and Carroll Moore, of course, you know, Donovan Carroll Moore, you told me about her as being very important in the New York library system, very important to the New York Library system. She was important in many, many ways. She wrote for the Herald Tribune. I think I&#39;m almost certain, for the Herald Tribune books. She wrote a column every week or the three hours. And it was book reviews and her general thoughts on books for children.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Have they been collected anywhere? Do they still exist? Them in books? And you used to be able to find all of them in the professional study room at Boys and Girls House, whether you still can or not, I don&#39;t know, but she was a very important influence on me. She was a very important influence in all librarians. And her word was law. There was also a storyteller called Mary Gould Davis. And you know her, I think because you, you know, some of her collections. She collected stories. She collected Spanish stories, mostly. She also in the New York system. She was also in the New York system. And one of the very first jobs I remember having as a public job was to go out and buy a corsage for her one Easter Monday. Easter Monday was always a meeting of the Ontario Library Association, which was a very important organisation in those days. It no longer is. And there was a children&#39;s meeting to which the librarians from all over the province came. They had the day off and there was usually a speaker. And this particular year a woman I had never heard of but had never forgotten, called Mary Gould Davis, was to come and speak on storytelling. Now, my job at that time were things like running out and getting her her corsage. This was before I went to library school. Do you remember what year it was? Yes, it was Easter of 1931 because I got the job in 1930. Easter of 31. I don&#39;t remember Mary Gould Davis&#39;s appearance or anything about her, but I remember still the story she told, which was the convent free from care.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And I had spent most of the day carrying water for tea and things like that up and down stairs, but they let me in to hear the story. What effect did it have on you? Do you remember? That must have been one of the very first stories that you heard. It was the same story that I knew from my early days in school, only I knew it as King John and the Abbot of Canterbury. You know, King John and the Abbot of Canterbury. And the three questions. No, it&#39;s King John who demands that the Abbot of Canterbury, who does nothing for his livelihood, should have something to worry him, and he gives him three questions to answer. You know, one of them is what? What am I worth? Yes, yes, I remember the answer to that in verse from the time I was about six for £0.30 our Saviour was sold 30 somethings of silver and gold. And I think you must all agree that your one penny worser than he. Yes, well, hers was the convent free from care, and it was a French king riding through the countryside. And he comes upon a convent gate in which is carved here. You live with her to care. And this is too much for him. And he demands that they have something to worry them. So he gives them three questions, and the abbot can&#39;t do it. But his little shepherd.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">Boy takes on the job.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And goes up into the answer to. The third question is, what am I thinking? And he says, you think that I am the Abbot of Canterbury? But Julian is shepherd boy. And you remember her telling that story. And this was telling that first story you actually heard. Told it told since it was the first story I ever heard tell told when anyone said it was storytelling, really, rather than an informal just telling. Yes. And do you remember the effect it had on you or the way in which she told it? Uh, no. But she was one of the people who told it perfectly straightforward story. You see, I don&#39;t remember her. I remember taking a look at the corsage and thinking, it&#39;s all right with your dress. Yes. So this was your very first experience. This was this was the story. But it&#39;s with me from 31 to now. That&#39;s very impressive. I could, if necessary, tell that story. Yes. So you would soaked it completely in on that occasion because the story was the only thing that mattered. Yes. And that was her theory as well. That was Marigold Davis. Some of the other great ones. There was a woman whose name was Bryant, and I think she preceded these people. I think she was quite a bit before, but she retold a lot of stories in versions for telling. I think nowadays you probably wouldn&#39;t consider them very good, but they were very successful and very pleasant. Now, did these they were all women, were they not that you told me about these women, these three women? Were they the only women in North America at that time teaching and telling stories? Was that the centre of it, or was it everywhere? And they were especially good? No, the libraries were the places, and I think they probably started it started the story, but it did become a library thing and all the literature of the time.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Children go to the library to hear stories. The Moffatts. Do you remember? Yes. That&#39;s a real storyteller, though. The woman who wrote the Moffatts, Eleanor Estes. She tells wonderful stories about her own experiences. Yes. Now, one of the first jobs I had was to get Miss Lands ready to go to the Great Conference in New Haven, and that was in June of 1931. I&#39;m almost certain 31 or 32, but I think 31. I know I lived in Brunswick Avenue at that time. I got her all ready to go, and I worked very late hours, and Miss Smith finally gave me Saturday off as a reward. As a reward. In those days, you worked Saturdays, too. Everybody did. I had two Saturdays off. I think in all those years. One was to go to Mary Baldwin&#39;s wedding and one was to see Johnny Box. He was seven. And so you prepared her for this conference? Prepared her for the conference. And no, it was a library conference at New Haven. But years and years later in Oshawa, I heard Eleanor Estes talk about that conference.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />She was the librarian, the young librarian in whose library some of the meetings were to be held. And one morning arrived, when all the work was over, the guests were assembled and the flowers looked nice and the sun was shining and the room was clean and nothing had gone wrong. Everything was done and she sat back and felt so pleased. And suddenly she heard the man who was making the opening, welcoming address say, and now Miss Estes will tell us something about her library. So she found her way up to the front of the crowd, and she turned round and she opened her mouth and no sound came, and she opened her mouth wider and no sound came. And then she opened her mouth very, very wide, and she heard a funny little voice from miles away that said, the library is open from 9 to 5. And then she went and sat down. But she could tell that sort of story about herself to perfection. To perfection? Yes, but she never went anywhere from then on without four speeches. They were written already that she could pop up and call upon if if everything deserted. So these New York women inspired the Toronto women, or vice versa. They inspired librarians, you see. Miss Smith took her library training at Enoch Pratt. Yes. And she was working for and Kalmar. And suddenly Doctor Locke decided that he needed children&#39;s work developed up here, not just a corner of the reference library where somebody called by her first name.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Yes. And little Mary, you know, looked after the children. Yes. A kiddy&#39;s corner, something serious, something serious. And it was during the First World War. And he brought Lillian Smith up. Well, that was considerable vision. Oh, he he was a man full of vision. He was a very interesting man. And Doctor Locke was George Locke. He was the chief librarian. And he was a very handsome big man, a Harvard man. Yes. He taught me to sing. Hey, hey, we&#39;re the lads from Iowa. And somebody said to me, he was a Harvard man. That&#39;s what they sing. Yes, but he was head of the library. He was head of the library service at Toronto Library. And at that time, that big new reference library, which isn&#39;t a reference library anymore, at the corner of Saint George and College had just been finished. The Eton, the Eton, College Street store, the beautiful Eaton Centre just been finished off and had just been finished also. And those two places in the Toronto General Hospital were the only places in Toronto where really knew, but I could find my way to them from anywhere. So you were then expected, skipping around from the very early days to the time when I&#39;ve been to library school? Yes. So this is not chronologically, this is not chronological, but it has a certain I hop back and forth. Yes. But then you went to library school in the very first story you told were the Aesop&#39;s fable, which you I didn&#39;t like.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Taught to tell them in library school. And then when I got out, I took courses in storytelling with Miss Trotter. Yes. And that was a different kettle of fish from the library storytelling. Now, I&#39;m not really being fair to Miss Smith, because she was filling in on a subject that is not hers. Yes. And she was teaching us her theories of storytelling, which were good. I mean, she was the power behind all the storytelling that was done in the Toronto public schools. She really believed she. Who? Yes. She believed in it. And? I&#39;d seen nothing like it. The children lined up in great long lines to come in, and they would sit and listen forever. Once, while I was at library school. Our whole class of children&#39;s librarians, all who were taking the children&#39;s option were invited down for an afternoon of Uncle Remus. Yes, Mary Baldwin and Francis Trotter, the two people whose speciality Uncle Remus was told stories alternately of all afternoon long. And we were given tea and sent home. This is almost unbelievable now, isn&#39;t it? Yes. That that would happen. Almost unbelievable. I didn&#39;t realise that. But then they told we had staff meetings and every once in a while, the staff meeting. The Wednesday staff meeting would be devoted to storytelling. Yes. And then every little while, us young things that were in Miss Trotter&#39;s class on. I forget what day, but let&#39;s say Mondays. We came in on Mondays and took a class with her in storytelling, and by the next Monday, we had to have a story learned and be ready to tell it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And could you do that easily enough? Oh yes, you could do that. I could learn stories easily. I didn&#39;t like telling them to my fellow. To my peers. I didn&#39;t really like it. I didn&#39;t all that much like listening to their stories. Can you put into words why you didn&#39;t like telling people something went wrong? It was just frightening to me. But I did love listening to the seniors, the good seniors, telling their stories. Yes, I loved particularly Mary Walker. Do you know Mary Walker? No I don&#39;t. Well, she was senior when I was 22. She is quite old now. I would think she would certainly be ten years older than me. Yes. Which would make her so. She was a senior librarian, you mean? Yes. And a storyteller. She was a senior librarian, you know, in every sense. And her specialities were the just so stories. And she could tell them to children all afternoon. She could tell them to children all afternoon, but she could tell them to me in a staff meeting. Yes, and he loved it. I loved it particularly. She loved some of the ones that were not my father&#39;s favourites. She told the butterfly that stamped, which was not one of my father&#39;s favourites, but I loved it and it sounded so grand. All the long biblical parts, you know. But the djinns and the afrits and the laws of the Medes and the Persians, which.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">Cannot be broken. And and then the little ending that said. But wasn&#39;t it clever of Dorcas? And that was the first time I realised that the.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Asides in the just the stories that I.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">Always thought were my father&#39;s to me, were written into the text.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />For she was her own daddy&#39;s best beloved. Just the way you are mine for for the Mariner he was also a high burning. He had his mummy&#39;s leave to paddle or he would never have done it, for he was a man of infinite Resources. And that was the first time we learned that. That was the first time I really realised that that was not daddy talking to me, because she suddenly said, but wasn&#39;t it clever and pompous? And that&#39;s what he said. So you were becoming under the spell of storytelling? Yes, very much so. And as far as you were concerned, were you able to feel free about telling or were you still very, very proud? I was very unhappy about it. And then I was sent to the library, which I was to run by myself. Good gracious, Alice. To the children&#39;s room. And this I was so fortunate. I got queen and queen and queen and lizard and Queen Street west at the corner of Lisgar, somewhere between Dufferin and Lansdowne. Is it still there? No, the the building is still there. It&#39;s a little old Carnegie library. It had a fire and it never was restored as a library. They built Parkdale, which was much bigger, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s still there as a city health. The building is still there. The building is still there and the health services use it. Why were you so fortunate to be sent there? Because of the public.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />The public? There were children. The public has changed there totally now. But in my day, they were almost solidly Eastern European. They. They were Slavs of one kind or another. Or Jewish children. There were. There was a great Ukrainian. Would that mean all these children love stories? Because it was in their culture. It was in their culture? Yes. They were told stories at home. They were accepted. Yes. I could tell them stories all day. Yes. They. They never stopped wanting them. They never stop wanting, would they? Did you have a formal time or how did you had to have a horrible time. What did you do? What&#39;s more, you, um. About this time of year in August, you would be preparing your fall story arc program. I might have decided to tell Steele&#39;s English fairy tales. And I had to send in to Miss Smith&#39;s office before the fall season started. My story program from September to Christmas for Saturday mornings. Every library had a story hour on Saturday morning, and it varied from the time, varied from one branch to another according to such things as. Such things as what you had in the way of a story room. If you had no story room, as we didn&#39;t, you had to give them a chance to come in and get their books marked in and get their books quickly marked out before you close the room, more or less, and had a story in it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Yes. Or if you some places it was convenient to one time or another. But it was Saturday morning, and what you told was usually one long wonder tale and one shorter story, and if it was going to be steals English fairy tales you&#39;ve chosen from that. And this is the kind of thing you were taught in your storytelling classes? Yes. It was the kind of thing you were taught in your storytelling classes, but you had your own choice of what you were going to tell. You were discouraged from telling modern stories. There were various reasons for that. One of them being that the stories from the oral tradition usually tell better. And we read, for instance, before you told Cinderella, you would read Walter de la mare&#39;s retelling of Cinderella, which is extremely beautiful, but it&#39;s not a good story telling story. But still, you had to get her consciousness. You had to get it in your consciousness, and you had to know what other versions were available, and you had to be able to defend your choice of the one you had chosen. There used to be a great deal of fighting in our little group about the relative merits of Steel and Jacobs. Yes, steel was a little wordier than Jacobs. Yes, but some people liked her better. Both were acceptable. Now, what would happen if you absorbed the stories and the different versions? And then you wrote your own version.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Never thought of such a thing. Was that considered not. That was considered not right. For instance, if you had attended your own version of a just so story, and I feel very strongly about this still, you practically, practically have their studies have had your head chopped off. Yes. That would have been considered. Really? I still think that&#39;s. And you still think so? Do you still think that of some of the stories from the oral tradition that came down in different versions? No, I don&#39;t. I think you have a right to change those. But if it&#39;s I don&#39;t know why you change it, because when you look at them and realise how very much alike they are after 2000 years, some of them, that must be the best way of saying it. So in those days, anyway, you you librarians and you read the different versions, then you would decide this is my version, and then you would learn that one, and then you would have to tell the other people why that was important to you, or why you liked it before. Before you started learning it, you discussed what you were doing. If you were still at that stage where you were in the classes, as you got a little older, you you were out of the classes. Did they tell you, uh, Francis Trotter and Lillian Smith and these other people.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Why they felt it was so important not only that children read it, but they heard them told that they could they expressed to you, or did they express to you the reasons that they expressed that to me? I really don&#39;t know that they did. I think Francis Trotter was the most likely to because she also, she and Jean Thompson got one of those, I think it was Rockefeller scholarships to go to Europe for a year and study things like storytelling, drama and puppetry in various countries, Russia, England and so on. They were and this was at the time when choral speaking was at its height. Yes. And they went to a school in London within the sound of Bow Bells, where there were brilliant boys of Polish Jewish origin who got all the university scholarships that were going and had a dreadful time when they got to Oxford because of their awful accents. And they the school boards counteracted that as well as they could by teaching them choral speaking. And Miss Trotter and Miss Thompson had a story about going to see various Christmas performances. One at a private school, a very expensive private school, which was really, they thought, quite shocking. It was. It was like a it was like a chorus in a, in a musical or not very good musical. Yes.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the world’s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-mp3-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your mp3 files to text">Automatically convert your mp3 files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="advanced search" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/organize-and-search?utm_source=embed">advanced search</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="automated subtitles" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/automated-subtitles?utm_source=embed">automated subtitles</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="enterprise-grade admin tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/admin-tools?utm_source=embed">enterprise-grade admin tools</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="secure transcription and file storage" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/security?utm_source=embed">secure transcription and file storage</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
