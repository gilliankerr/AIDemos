I graduated from McGill in 1930.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />Yes</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />The year before, people had their choice of jobs. It was at a peak, and you could have what seemed a fabulous salary, and you could choose anything you wanted to do. And here, suddenly in 1930, there were no jobs available for anybody. No jobs for anybody. And I came up on a visit to Toronto with my friend Alice Hand, who lived in Hamilton.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />Yes</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />Because I talked in a vague way about wanting to work with children in books. I had an idea of getting a job in a publishing house of what I could do in a publishing house. I have no idea now. And I had no idea then, but I talked about it. You talk about things when there are no chances of anything real happening. And I stayed with Alice and her family at their house on the highway between Hamilton and Toronto, near Burlington, and we used to come into Hamilton on Sunday mornings to church. And one Sunday morning the car broke down. So we went into the rectory to wait for the man to come and fix the car. The rector was Canon Judd, who had been the principal at KCS in Halifax.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />Yes</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />When I was at Netherwood and he used to change pulpits occasionally with Doctor Hibbert, who was the boys principal at my school.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />So I knew about him, but his sister was there and she was very nice to me. I was extremely shy and she asked me what I was doing. So I told her in my airy fashion that I was trying to find a job with children and books.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />And how old were you then, Alice?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />22.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />22!</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />22, chronologically. About 12, I think.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />12 emotionally?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />Yes. Oh, in any way. I was I was really a child. And she said to me, oh, well, you must see Lillian Smith. The person you must see is Lillian Smith. So I said, Who is Lillian Smith? And she told me who was Lillian Smith, and I made an appointment to see her. She just phoned her up and said, I am Alice. And, well, they gave me an appointment to see her. I don&#39;t think she was very willing to see me, but she she agreed to. And Alice drove me to town, and Mrs. Hand drove me to town, and we I went down to keep the appointment and Miss Smith. This method. Don&#39;t think wanted to see me at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Ann: </strong><br />How could you tell?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />Because she kept me waiting about three hours. Three hours? And I had never seen anything like the place where I waited. Where was it? It was the reading room at Boys and girls house.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Alice: </strong><br />I had never seen a children&#39;s library like this before. I had never seen anything like it before in my life. And all thoughts of publishing houses faded from my mind. And I wanted this. I didn&#39;t want any other thing in the world. I wanted a job here. Could you describe what it was that drew you? Or what happened to you, what you saw? It was children with unlimited books and people who seemed to have time to tell them where to find what they wanted and to get them a book like the last one they had. And it seemed important. Instead of telling them they shouldn&#39;t be reading so much, they should be out playing. They were helping them get get books. They were poor little Children not extra clean, many of them. And it was it was dark and the place was just full of books. Miss Lyons came and talked to me and she took me out into the reading room. That&#39;s Kathleen Lyons, and she showed me a number of books, very beautiful treasure type books like The Buddha de Marvell, Joan of Arc and A Lovely Thing in the Bayeux Tapestry. Things like that that I found very exciting. She gave me a little list to check with the books I had read, and I could check most of the books on the list, though I didn&#39;t realise that when I was checking a Robin Hood it probably wasn&#39;t the right Robin Hood or when I checked King Arthur.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />It wasn&#39;t the right King Arthur. I did it in perfectly good faith. And then I saw Miss Smith, and she explained to me that she had no jobs. She just had no jobs. There were no jobs. This was the fall of 1930, she explained to me. So was the interview very short? Not very short, I don&#39;t think. I can&#39;t remember an awful lot about it. I remember that I cried. I told her I had never wanted a job before. Really? Oh, and you&#39;d fallen in love with a job. I wanted this, and then suddenly I pulled out my last card, my Trump, and I said, I can type, and I handed her a certificate. She said I could type. Those were days when everybody couldn&#39;t take. Aha. So it was special. And she said, well, she didn&#39;t think she had any jobs, but she would see and she would let me know. And she took my address and I went home feeling we didn&#39;t have it. And I had also applied to a, a couple of women, one of whom was called, believe it or not, True Davidson. True Davidson and the true Davidson, the true Davidson and Margaret McKenzie. And they were both young women and they were running an employment bureau.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And I went to see them and I got true Davidson, who was a young woman with lots and lots of beads, and she gave me some dictation, and I didn&#39;t know the word format. She had to explain to me what format meant. And she said, you are going to work in a publishing house and you don&#39;t know the word format. I met her many, many years later. Oh, certainly 40 years later, and I think maybe more at the opening of a new library in East Shore. Yes. And she I was being shown down the receiving line. You see, I said to her, you won&#39;t remember me, but I came to you long, long ago looking for a job. And she said you were my first customer. So she didn&#39;t know the word format. It&#39;s almost unbelievable, isn&#39;t it? So that was. That&#39;s the reason why she was so popular, I think, with everybody because she had this way of remembering. But but I really had very little hope of the other job materialising. Do you remember what you wore and what you looked like when you went there, and what Lillian Smith looked like? I remember what Lillian Smith looked like. But then, you see, I was 22, so she looked old to me. She looked old, like my mother. She was probably about 40 something. I don&#39;t know how old she was.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">Uh. I wasn&#39;t all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />That interested in her. I was interested in this place. And I had never seen the like of it before. Where was the boys and girls library at that time? It was at 40 Saint George Street, and it was called Boys and Girls House. Yes. And it was a house. Sometime. I&#39;ll show you a picture of it. I have a postcard of it. Does it still exist? It exists as a branch library, but the house doesn&#39;t exist. It was declared unsafe. It was pulled down and was pulled down. And it was too bad because it was a beautiful old house and the children loved it. It was all theirs. There was a circulating room as you went in the hall. There was a little room at the back with picture books for the little children, and then there was a little theatre behind it. Sounds magical. Oh, it was absolutely magical. Offices were upstairs, and there was a picture collection and a reference collection upstairs. It was. It was beyond belief. Well, I went back home with Alice and we came in and tried the true Davidson thing. One day she applied also, and and suddenly there was a letter from his lines. I still have it to saying that Miss Smith had a job for me. If I would like to come in and see her about it. So I went in and saw her about it, not knowing that I was going to be killed, and I had an overnight bag and a toothbrush and nothing else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />And I was kept that day, and I got the job and it was. So you had to go in from out of town, then from Hamilton. From Hamilton. I still have. Nearly a month of that. Yes. And we went to the Y. Got a room there. You had your job first, and then you went to the Y with your bag and your toothbrush. And. Alice. Yes. Who stayed with me? Where was the Y in those days? It was in Elm Street. And it was. It was awful. It was downtown, in the middle of the noise and confusion of summer. Oh, I&#39;ve never seen anything as awful as Elm Street was. I had never seen anything like it in those days. But the job was to be this lime secretary and to type her letters for her. I had shorthand and quickly forgot the shorthand because it embarrassed her to dictate letters to me. So she wrote the letters out, and then I typed them, and pretty soon they began to use me in the library downstairs as well, just for jobs at first. And then little by little, they let me work with the children. And how did you start working with the children? What would they let you do? They would let me help them find books, because I knew a fair number of the books, and those were the days before certification had come in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />You were trained the you were trained within the library. So if you were hired within the library system, they could train you and then train like an apprentice system. Yes. Rather than giving you any sort of diploma or. Yes. But then the certification came in in a very few years. But you. What did you graduate from? Mcgill in English and history? Yes. What sort of, uh. Um, how many years did you go or what was the four years? But from. Not from grade 13? Yes, from grade 12. English and history and history. Would that be an honours? That was a that was an honours BA at McGill, which was different from an honours BA at Toronto, where you come in and take four years and tell them your grade 13. But anyway, there we were. And then my mother came up to see me and she had a long talk with Miss Smith. I don&#39;t think my mother knew what it was all about, but Miss Smith explained to her that I should go to library school because certification was coming in. Mm. Was that sensible advice? Oh, that was the only advice at the age I was if you were senior staff at that time, certification did not apply to you because of. But if you were a junior staff, you had to be certified or you couldn&#39;t or you couldn&#39;t show up. So I went to library school. A year after that, that was 32, 33.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />I went to library school and then I was a children&#39;s librarian. And then came the rub. I found that I was expected to tell stories. Me, me tell stories all through my school days. My teacher said to me, speak up, Alice. Speak up. And the little school I went to in Ireland. It didn&#39;t matter very much whether I spoke up or not. Why was that? Because we didn&#39;t have any classes. We didn&#39;t do anything on a large scale. So everything was very small and intimate. And if you had a soft voice, it didn&#39;t matter. It didn&#39;t matter. It was a 1 to 1 sort of arrangement. But when I got the other thing I&#39;d never done was write on a board. So talking to a whole class and writing on a board were things that were absolutely unknown to me and storytelling. And I knew I could never do it. And I also stammered. You stammered. Oh, I stammered. From early childhood. No, I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t remember stammering in early childhood. I remember stammering in my grown up, frightened young days. I don&#39;t think you have any concept of how I was so scared. I was no one of my early bosses, Mary Baldwin told her. I reminded her of a frightened rabbit hole. And I think I probably did. Can you remember how it felt? Oh, I was just petrified. I was petrified of everyone and everything. And I had never.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker1: </strong><br />Been really scolded except at home. The way children are. But I had never been scolded outside till I came into the library staff. But it was the reason why I didn&#39;t want a job. Why I was so scared of jobs. I had read books about people with jobs. Yes. And there was the boss who scolded you because you were late. Actually, it was all very, very kind indeed. I used to go home with Alice for the weekends, and Mrs. Hand, who came into town on business, would drive us back on Monday morning. And one Monday morning she had a small
